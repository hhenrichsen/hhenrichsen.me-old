## Bio

Hey, I'm Hunter. I'm a Computer Science student based in Utah. I enjoy coding in
multiple languages, including but not limited to Java, JavaScript, Kotlin and
Python. I also enjoy writing, teaching, gaming, reading, and drawing. I'm a
dungeon master for two Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. 

## Uses

* I use Neovim as my main text editor, and IntelliJ as my main IDE for Java. My
  configuration for vim is available
  [here](https://github.com/hhenrichsen/vim-config). 
* [Fantasque Sans Mono](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans) is my font of
  choice. I use a NerdFonts patched version from
  [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FantasqueSansMono).
* My favorite color theme is [Nord](https://nordtheme.com/) by
  [ArcticIceStudio](https://github.com/arcticicestudio).
